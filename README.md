Data and code used for generating plots in the paper: Ye C et al., The cyanobacterial circadian clock couples to pulsatile proccesses using pulse amplitude modulation, Current Biology, 2024.

The code and data are grouped into seperate folders based on the Figures in which they are used.

Some general MATLAB functions are in a seperate folder named as 'MATLAB functions'. If the function code is not written by us, we also included the licence file. This folder should be added to your MATLAB path before running other code in the Figure folders.
